# Exploring Goncharov Configurations

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore the optimization problem of Goncharov d-configurations (finding a set of n points that lie on a unit sphere in d-dimensions and are as far apart from each other as possible) and observing their properties.

## Problem Solving
The project addresses the following key problems:
- Formulating an optimization problem to find n points on the unit sphere in d-dimensions, maximizing their distance from each other (Goncharov d-Configuration).
- Analyzing distances and angles to distinguish regular configurations (tetrahedron and equilateral triangle) from other configurations.
- Comparing Goncharov 3-Configurations with randomly generated points on the unit sphere to assess coverage of the sphere.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- Python 
- Numpy

## Concepts Used
- Projected Gradient Descent
- Vector manipulation
- Dimensionality and shape analysis
- Comparative analysis of statistical measures (average, variance)
